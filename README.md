# pokemonCardCollector

When I was younger, I was a big fan of Pokemon and had a ton of Pokemon cards lying about but never could tell I had which cards and how many. 

Many years later, Pokemon is still ever popular and this is a personal Pokemon Card app written in C++ that allows the user to keep track of their collection of Pokemon cards.
